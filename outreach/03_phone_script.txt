PHONE SCRIPT: INSTITUTIONAL OUTREACH

[OPENING]
Hello, this is Kevin Lewis calling from Kevin Lewis, Inc. I'm reaching out to [Department Name] at [Institution Name].

Is this a good time? I'm looking to connect with the person who oversees [relevant area: career services/student development/academic partnerships].

[IF CONNECTED TO DECISION MAKER]
Thank you for taking my call. I'll be brief.

I work with institutions like yours to build competitive advantages through practical, workplace-ready development programs. These aren't generic workshops—they're structured systems designed specifically for your [students/emerging professionals/rising talent].

[QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS]
- What are your current priorities around [career readiness/professional development/student outcomes]?
- Are you seeing gaps between what your [students/graduates] know and what employers expect?
- Do you have existing partnerships for professional skills training, or is this something you're exploring?

[VALUE PROPOSITION]
What I bring to institutions is a proven framework that addresses:
- Communication fundamentals that translate across industries
- Strategic positioning for competitive job markets  
- Practical execution skills employers actively seek

These programs integrate directly into your existing structure—whether that's credit-bearing courses, professional development series, or co-curricular programming.

[DIFFERENTIATION]
Unlike standard career workshops, this is outcome-focused training backed by measurable skill development. Your [students/participants] walk away with documented capabilities, not just exposure.

[NEXT STEPS]
I'd like to send you a brief overview that outlines how this works and what results look like. After you've had a chance to review it, we can schedule a 20-minute call to discuss fit.

What's the best email address to send that to?

[OBJECTION HANDLING]

OBJECTION: "We already have career services."
RESPONSE: "That's excellent—strong career services are essential. What I provide is complementary: structured skill-building that feeds into what your career services team does. Think of it as upstream development that makes their work more effective."

OBJECTION: "We don't have budget for this right now."
RESPONSE: "I understand budget constraints. That's why I'd like to start with a conversation about what's possible within your existing framework. Some institutions fund this through professional development budgets, others through departmental partnerships. Let's explore what makes sense for you."

OBJECTION: "Can you send me information first?"
RESPONSE: "Absolutely. I'll send you a concise overview today. It will include program structure, outcomes data, and how other institutions have implemented this. Once you've reviewed it, I'll follow up to answer any questions."

OBJECTION: "We're not looking to add new programs."
RESPONSE: "I appreciate that. This isn't about adding more—it's about strengthening what you already do. Many institutions integrate this into existing structures without creating new overhead. Worth a conversation?"

[CLOSING]
I appreciate your time today. I'll get that information to you by [specific timeframe], and I'll follow up [specific day] to see if it's worth exploring further.

If anything changes or you have questions in the meantime, you can reach me directly at [contact information].

Thank you again.
